Hey, I'm Heeren Darji.

It's awesome to see you here! I'm a kid, or I like to believe so, who finds programming and computers really interesting. I'm also a sophomore Computer engineering student.I'd be honest with you, ssshhhh, listen I'm not very good at programming yet, but I'm learning and putting in a lot of effort and want to learn it deeply.


If you do have any silly or super smart question to discuss about feel absolutely free to email(heerendarji@gmail.com) or tweet(@heerendarji). 

See you soon!    	 :)
